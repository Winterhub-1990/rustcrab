### How Can I Contribute?
You can contribute to this repository through <i>**Issues**</i> and <i>**Pull Requests (PRs)**</i>. Before submitting your own, please search for existing Issues and PRs to avoid duplicates.

## Issues
Issues are for reporting problems with the app, requesting new features, or discussing potential changes before creating a PR.

If you find an Issue that matches your problem, please add your reproduction details to that Issue instead of creating a new one. Also, adding a reaction to an Issue helps indicate to maintainers that the problem affects multiple users.

## Pull Requests
PRs are always welcome!

Aim to follow the existing coding style and conventions. Ensure your code is consistent with the style, formatting, and conventions used throughout the codebase.

For changes that impact core functionality or introduce breaking changes, consider opening an Issue to discuss your proposal first. While not mandatory, this can save time in creating and reviewing the changes.

### Creating a PR
This repository follows the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow:

1. **Fork the repository to your own Github account**.

2. **Clone the project to your machine**.

3. **Create a branch locally with a concise and descriptive name**.

4. **Commit changes to the branch**.

5. **Push changes to your fork**.

6. **Open a PR in the Rustcrab repo and provide a detailed explanation of the changes you made**.

Thank you & See you around! üëã
